## Guidance of whitebox testing

- This is an template for testing a function (whitebox)
- Each of the call in a test, calling a function should produce a single sheet for each
- For those value of the argument which aren't provided (use default value in go), don't need to mention
- The function name should be in the format of `package.(StructName.)?.Func`, for ex "domain.Attribute.Create", "domain.Category.Update".
- The defect ID should be mentioned if there is any defect found during the test, otherwise leave it blank. The ID should be in form of "DF-{Module}-{FunctionName}-01", for ex "DF-At-C-01" for Attribute Create function, "DF-P-UV-01" for Product Update variant function
- In the "Confirm" section, do not just write "Result" (Success/Error). You must list the important fields of the struct/return value (e.g., Name, Status). You may skip ID or timestamps if they are just "not nil", but for logic-critical fields, list them.
- If an error is expected, write a sample error message or the error type (e.g., "Key: 'Category.Name' Error:Field validation for 'Name' failed...").
- DO NOT change the format of the table (transposing,...), otherwise the parsing script may not work.

## Detailed Layout Explanation (Stylesheet)

The "Sheet" section uses a **transposed matrix** layout, which differs from standard test case tables.

### Structure

1.  **Columns represent Test Cases**:
    - The header row starts with empty structure cells.
    - From the 6th column onwards, each column represents a unique Test Case ID (e.g., `UTCID01`, `UTCID02`).
2.  **Rows represent Variables/Values**:
    - **Condition Section**: Lists input variables.
      - The main variable name is in the second column (e.g., "a", "Name Length").
      - Specific values for that variable are listed in subsequent rows in the 4th column (e.g., "0", "1", "100").
      - An `O` (or `X`) is placed in the intersection of a Value Row and a Test Case Column to indicate that specific input is used for that test case.
    - **Confirm/Return Section**: Lists expected outputs.
      - Similar to conditions, possible return values or states are listed in rows.
      - An `O` marks the expected result for that column's test case.
3.  **Result Section**:
    - Contains metadata for the test execution (Type, Pass/Fail status, Date, Defect ID).
